Any helper modules that are shared by the machines in this machinepack live here.


> **NOTE:**

> This example documents current best-practices for building open-source machinepacks. It is relatively close to what will end up in the final version, but there are a few assumptions made here which are still open questions and may change as our team identifies problems or more effective strategies.  Keep in mind that the machine specification is still a draft- it is not finalized.  It will continue to be refined over coming months.
